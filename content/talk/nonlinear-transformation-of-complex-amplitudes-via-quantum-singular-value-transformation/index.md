title: Nonlinear transformation of complex amplitudes via quantum singular value
  transformation
abstract: Due to the linearity of quantum operation, it is not straightforward
  to implement the nonlinear transformation on a quantum computer, making some
  practical tasks like a neural network hard to be achieved. In this work, we
  define a task called the \textit{nonlinear transformation of complex
  amplitudes} and provide an algorithm based on quantum singular value
  transformation. We also provide a thorough discussion about how to implement
  practical tasks such as a neural network using complex amplitudes with this
  procedure.
